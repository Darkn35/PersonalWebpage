                  <br>
                  <p>On Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an official name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19 — making sure not to reference Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus originated. COVID-19 stands for Corona Virus Disease 19.</p>

                    <h5>ABS-CBN Quo-Warranto</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Solicitor General Jose Calida’s upcoming quo warranto case vs. broadcast giant ABS-CBN would be seen as “government’s harassment” and “a clear assault on press freedom,” Cagayan de Oro Rep. Rufus Rodriguez said.Rodriguez made the remarks as Calida is reportedly set to question before the Supreme Court (SC) anytime the supposed handover of the Kapamilya network to the Lopezes during the Aquino administration in 1986, which he believed was void from the beginning.

                        According to Rodriguez, it will not be only seen “as government’s harassment of ABS-CBN,” but also a “clear assault on press freedom as enshrined in our Constitution.”</p>

                  <h5>Taal Eruption 2020</h5>
                  <br>
                  <p>As of Saturday, January 25, the <abbr title="National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council">NDRRMC</abbr>  and the <abbr title="Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology">PHIVOLCS</abbr>  have
                     reported a total of 950 volcano tectonic earthquakes in the Taal area since the eruption,
                      176 of which were felt. The strongest were a series of Mw 4.1 magnitude earthquakes originating
                       6 kilometres northwest of Agoncillo, Batangas, which were recorded at least thrice:
                        at 11:56 pm on January 12, 3:11 am on January 13, and 6:35 am later that day.
                         As a result, an Intensity <abbr title="weak">III</abbr> on the PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale was felt in 
                         Tagaytay and an Intensity <abbr title="slightly felt">II</abbr> was felt in Malabon. Between 11:39 pm on January 13
                          and 5:50 am the following day, PHIVOLCS reported a total of 44 earthquakes in the towns of 
                          Calaca, Laurel, Lemery, Mataasnakahoy, San Luis, Taal and Talisay in Batangas, and Alfonso 
                          in Cavite; among the strongest were a magnitude Mw  3.6 in Taal, which was felt at an 
                          Intensity III in Tagaytay, and a magnitude Mw 3.9 originating 7 kilometres northeast of 
                          Talisay at 2:05 am, measuring an Intensity <abbr title="moderately strong">IV</abbr> in Tagaytay and Intensity 
                          II in Malabon and Pasay. As a result of these constant earthquakes, numerous fissures or cracks 
                          began to appear across different barangays in the Batangas towns of Agoncillo, Lemery, San Nicolas, 
                          and Talisay, the towns within the 14-kilometer radius danger zone of Taal. A fissure also transected
                           the road connecting Agoncillo to Laurel. On Wednesday, January 15, PHIVOLCS reported that the water 
                           in the main crater lake on Taal Volcano Island has drained; the lake measured 1.9 kilometers 
                           wide and 4 metres (13 ft) above sea level. Portions of the Pansipit River, 
                           had also drained as a result of "the ground deformation caused by an upward 
                           movement of the magma" It is the same process that caused the series of earthquakes. 
                           PHIVOLCS have also hinted on underwater fissures in Taal Lake where the water may have 
                           drained into. By January 27 from 5 am until January 28, only 3 volcanic earthquakes were 
                           recorded with magnitudes 1.5 to 2.2, with no felt event. As recorded by the 
                           United States Geological Survey, 92 earthquakes were detected in the past 24 hours. 
                           Four of them are low frequency events, which are "caused by cracks resonating as magma 
                           and gases move toward the surface". PHIVOLCS also noted the low frequency events and they 
                           recorded 170 volcanic earthquakes in its 8 am bulletin.</p>
